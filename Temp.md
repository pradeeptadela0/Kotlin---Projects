Online Shopping Cart System


Problem Description
Develop a basic online shopping cart system where users can interact with a virtual cart to manage their purchases. The system should allow users to add items to the cart, view the contents of the cart, and calculate the total price of the items. Each item in the cart is represented by a Product class, which includes details such as the product name, price, and quantity. The Cart class will manage a collection of Product objects, providing functionality to add products, remove them, and compute the total cost. The system should provide a simple text-based interface for users to interact with and see their shopping cart details and total price.
